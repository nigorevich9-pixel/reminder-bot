Goal: Fix reminder-bot markdown docs so they don't reference non-existent system doc paths.

Reason: System documentation was moved/standardized under `/root/server-docs/docs/`, but reminder-bot docs still linked to legacy `/root/docs/*` paths that do not exist in this workspace.

Scope:
- Updated `/root/reminder-bot/CONTRIBUTING.md` to reference `/root/server-docs/docs/README.md` and `/root/server-docs/docs/*`.
- Updated `/root/reminder-bot/SECURITY.md` to reference `/root/server-docs/docs/security.md`.
- Updated `/root/reminder-bot/OPS.md` to reference `/root/server-docs/docs/ops.md`.
