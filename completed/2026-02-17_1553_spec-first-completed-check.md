# Enforce completed notes for non-doc changes

Timestamp: 2026-02-17 15:53 UTC
Goal: Introduce a lightweight “Specification-First” workflow enforcement.
Reason: Prevent changes landing without an explicit goal/reason/scope note in the PR diff.
Scope: `completed/`, `scripts/check_completed_note.sh`, `check.sh`.
